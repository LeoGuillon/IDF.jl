# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed. Here's the workflow for development of new features.

```
master             # Stable branch, always ready to be tagged
dev                # Development branch. New features, refactoring, bug and hotfix
                   # are integrated into dev before going into master.
feature/           # New feature needs a `feature` prefix
   <feature-name> 
```
